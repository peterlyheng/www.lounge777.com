    <h1>Frequently asked questions (FAQ) about our Free2play online casino Lounge777</h1>

    <section>
                    <h2>What is Lounge777 and how do I sign up for it?</h2>
            <p>Lounge777 is an online portal where you can play slots and casino games for free. New games are always being added and there are 3 different types of jackpots for you to play for. You can easily register by visiting our greeting site and entering your desired user name under "Choose your player name". Then provide a valid email address and a password of your choice, and you'll be ready to play. You can also login via a social media account, gaining extra Chips with each and every login. To do this, click on the social media account icon located in the upper right hand corner of the screen under "Already a player?".</p>
                    <h2>How do I start a game?</h2>
            <p>As soon as you have logged in to our site, you’ll be automatically located at our games webpage. There, you'll find a large variety of casino games, especially slots. When playing, you not only have the opportunity to win Chips, you are also gaining experience points (XP) in the process. To see how many Chips you've collected, take a look at "ACCOUNT" in the upper right side of the screen. There you’ll see the amount of Chips you currently have on your balance. Located right above your number of Chips is an XP bar, which shows you how far you still have to go until you reach the next level. Right above the XP bar, you can see what your current level is.

                    <h2>How do I acquire or earn Chips?</h2>
            <p>You have the chance to win Chips with every round of every game. Select the amount of Chips you would like to bet and with a little luck, your selected win lines might win or maybe even score you a "Big Win", a "Mega Win", or one of our three jackpots. You stock up your Chips account with every win. But here are even more options to acquire Chips: <br> <br> <h3 class="subtitle">Login via a social media platform</h3> The easiest way to get Chips is to log into Lounge777 via a social media platform profile. This will gain you extra Chips and will have you connected with friends while playing. By the way: With every day you log yourself in via this social media platform, you gain free Chips as an extra bonus – pretty awesome, right? <br> <br> <h3 class="subtitle">Magic Bonus Wheel</h3> You can collect your Magic Bonus once every two hours by spinning the Magic Bonus Wheel. To further help you keep track of when you'll be able to spin the wheel, there's a "Next Bonus" tracker located just below the wheel. There you can see running time informing you when you'll next be able to spin the Magic Bonus Wheel and earn yourself more free Chips. <br> <br> <h3 class="subtitle">Daily Login Bonus</h3> Log into Lounge777 every day and we will give you a login bonus. These Chips are added directly to your Chips account. Tip: By logging in via a social media platform, you may give your login bonus an extra push every day as well, as you get additional Chips for each daily login via the social media platform. <br> <br> <h3 class="subtitle">Jackpots</h3> At our casino, you'll have the chance to hit a whole line-up of jackpots AND win a whole bunch of Chips! <br> <br> The most important jackpot is YOUR jackpot. Click on "MyJackpot" right in the middle of the lower edge of your screen to open your personal jackpot. In addition, we feature game-based jackpots that you can also hit! To find out which games you can win a jackpot in, just look for the jackpot sum, which is displayed right on the slot display itself (i.e. the one you see in the lobby). <br> <br> <h3 class="subtitle">Buying Chips</h3> In the upper right corner of the web page, you will find an overview of your Chips account. Click on the large Chip coin symbol entitled "Shop" to buy Chips in our shop. Once per 24 hours, you’ll also have the opportunity to collect a "Free store bonus" right there in the shop. When you go into the shop, you will find Chip packages that are chock full of Chips for you. The more you buy, the larger the discount we'll give you on your Chip purchase. With a click on "Buy now", you are then led to the cashier where you can select your preferred method of payment. You will then be guided through the payment process step by step and the Chips will be directly added to your balance. It couldn't be any easier! <br> <br> <h3 class="subtitle">Watching Videos</h3> You've used up your Chips a little faster than you had planned? Well, then you can start refilling your Chips account by watching a short video clip. Just click the "Watch videos" button located on the right side of the screen (third from top). Spend some time watching the videos and Chips will be added to your Chips account. Important: You have to watch the complete video right to the end in order to get those Chips accredited to your balance. <br> <br> <h3 class="subtitle">Inviting Friends</h3> Playing with friends is always more fun. That's why we reward every friend invitation with Bonus Chips. But that's not all: You get extra Chips for every invite, plus another bonus if your friend accepts the invite. You can search for and invite friends by clicking on "ACCOUNT" next to your profile pic and then once there, clicking on "Community". <br> <br> <h3 class="subtitle">More</h3> Follow us on social media so that you don't miss any events.</p>
                    <h2>How do I win a Jackpot and how large are my winnings?</h2>
            <p>With every spin of each and every game/slot, you'll be increasing the sum of your personal jackpot! With the aid of your daily lucky numbers and the MyJackpot Wheel of Luck, you may just be able to hit it. For more information, just open up your "MyJackpot" portal by clicking on the "MyJackpot" sum located on the lower, middle edge of your screen. In order to win game-based jackpots, you must play with the required MinBet for the respective jackpot. If you bet more than the required jackpot wager, your chances of winning a jackpot will also INCREASE! <br> <br> And how exactly do you win?! Well, as soon as you play with the required MinBet for that jackpot, then every spin you make gives you the chance to activate the Jackpot Wheel. With the Jackpot Wheel, you can then hit an entire jackpot or just a part of the jackpot! The Jackpot Wheel does NOT decrease or minimize your chance of winning an entire jackpot, but rather ensures your shot at some really great Chips winnings!</p>

                    <h2>How do the slots work and what do the symbols mean?</h2>
            <p>In order to start a game of slots, just click on it and the game will automatically open. In each game of slots, there are <b>5 reels with various symbols</b>. Depending on how the symbols are arranged on the reels when they stop, you win or lose Chips. These formations are called <b>Win lines</b>. In the lower left hand corner, you select how many of those lines you want to play on. Different kinds of slot machines offer you different amounts of win lines you can play on. <b>The more win lines</b> you select, <b>the more Chips</b> you are ultimately betting. Right next to the button that lets you select the win lines, you can chose how many Chips you want to bet on each line. These two combined add up to the amount of chips you are betting per round. You can adjust this amount for each round you play. You can also directly select to play the maximum amount of Chips – in order to do so, just click the "MAX BET" button. All winnings are counted from left to right <b>on the reels that are next to each other</b>. The exact rules for free spins, the Scatter symbol, bonus symbols, and the amount of winning lines are provided in detail in the paytable of each slot game. The following is just some general information: <br> <br> <h3 class="subtitle">Scatter Symbol</h3> The Scatter symbol can appear anywhere on the reels. Depending on the slots game, you will win a certain amount of free spins with a certain amount of Scatter symbols. In some cases, the reels the symbols appear on (for example, 9 Scatter symbols on reels 2-4) are also important. You can find out which conditions have to be met for what type of win by clicking the "i" in the lower left hand corner of the slot machine. While all symbols only count in the right order on the winning lines, the Scatter symbols can also win on other reels. <br> <br> <h3 class="subtitle">Win Lines</h3> At the beginning of the game, you select how many of the possible win lines you want to play and how many Chips you want to bet. Only the highest win per line counts. If there are multiple wins on one line, they get added together. The win is credited to your balance as soon as it is accepted or the gamble option is over. <br> <br> <h3 class="subtitle">Bonus Symbol</h3> Bonus Symbols can trigger free spins or possibly even special winnings. For this, a certain amount of bonus symbols will have to show up on the reels at the same time. To find out which symbols actually serve as bonus symbols, how many bonus symbols are required in order to win, and to see descriptions of other special functions, please consult the paytable of each individual slot game. <br> <br> <h3 class="subtitle">Wild Symbol</h3> The Wild symbol is a joker and it shows up in most slots. As a joker, the Wild symbol is representative of most of the other symbols in a game and with that, completes a whole bunch of win combinations. The only symbol that this joker usually cannot represent is the bonus symbol. Check out the help section of the respective game to find out which symbol a Wild joker for that respective game and for which other symbols it can be the representative. <br> <br> <h3 class="subtitle">Gamble</h3> Some slot machines allow you to gamble with your winnings. Either you take the winnings or you decide that you want to gamble with them, something that could lead to winning even more Chips – but possibly also losing them. After you've won, just press "GAMBLE" if you want to gamble your winnings. In order to double your winnings, select a card color, either red or black. If your choice is correct, your winnings will be doubled. If you select the correct card symbol (hearts, diamonds, spades, clubs) you can even quadruple your winnings. You can gamble with your winnings up to 5 times in a row. <br> <br> <h3 class="subtitle">Free Spins</h3> Free spins can, for example, be triggered by three or more simultaneously appearing bonus symbols. During these free spins, you can win the same things as you can during normal spins while the number of lines and your bet per line remain the same as they were when the free spins were triggered. The symbols that trigger free spins and the amount of free spins that are triggered as well as detailed information on other special functions can be found by clicking on the "i" (or the corresponding paytable) in the lower left hand corner.</p>
